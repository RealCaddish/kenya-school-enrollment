          <p> Primary schools in Kenya implemented policies towards a higher enrollment rate for female
            children similar to their male counterparts. The government has been interested in visually expressing
            these enrollment rates on a grade-by-grade basis throughout primary schools in various counties throughout
            the country. Many of these schools have recently achieved an equal threshold, enrolling children of both
            sexes
            at a similar rate. Yet some schools have yet to achieve this equilibrium. Schools in the north and northeast
            are
            have a generally lower enrollment rate for girls compared to boys. In contrast, schools in the western and
            central
            portions of the country have achieved a nearly comparable state of equilibrium between enrollment rates.
            It is important to note that the density of schools is generally in this area. The schools to the north and
            northeast of the
            country in contrast, are more isolated. </p>
          <h2 class='txt-xl mt18 mb12 align-center'>Moving towards Equal Enrollment</h2>
          <p>According to UNICEF, the Kenyan government has allocated a significant amount of its revenue towards
            education. Many policies in Kenya are now favoring equal enrollment for both male and female primary
            students.
            If you're interested in more data concerning these policies, check out the <a
